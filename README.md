# Line and Circle Detection using Hough Transform and Edge Detection

The **Hough Transform** is a powerful technique for detecting geometric shapes, such as lines and circles, in an image. Combined with edge detection methods, it enables accurate detection of these shapes by identifying patterns in a transformed parameter space.

## 1. Edge Detection
Edge detection is the preliminary step in detecting lines or circles. It enhances the boundaries between objects in an image by identifying points where intensity changes significantly.

### Popular Edge Detection Methods:
- **Sobel Filter**: Highlights gradients in specific directions.
- **Canny Edge Detector**: Uses gradient-based methods with noise suppression for precise edge detection.
- **Prewitt and Roberts Operators**: Simpler methods for detecting edges, suitable for less noisy images.

### Steps in Edge Detection:
1. Convert the image to grayscale (if it's in color).
2. Apply a Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
3. Use a gradient-based operator (e.g., Sobel or Canny) to highlight edges.

## 2. Hough Transform
The Hough Transform maps points from the image space into a parameter space, where geometric shapes can be identified as peaks or patterns.

### 2.1 Line Detection
For line detection, the transform converts the Cartesian equation of a line:  
\[ y = mx + c \]  
to a polar form:  
\[ \rho = x \cos \theta + y \sin \theta \]  

Where:
- \( \rho \): Distance from the origin to the closest point on the line.
- \( \theta \): Angle of the line normal with respect to the x-axis.

### Steps in Line Detection:
1. Perform edge detection to extract edge points.
2. Transform each edge point into parameter space (\( \rho, \theta \)).
3. Accumulate votes in a 2D accumulator array (\( \rho, \theta \)).
4. Identify peaks in the accumulator array to detect lines.

### 2.2 Circle Detection
For circles, the Hough Transform uses the parametric equation:  
\[ (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 \]  

Where:
- \( (a, b) \): Center of the circle.
- \( r \): Radius of the circle.

### Steps in Circle Detection:
1. Perform edge detection to extract edge points.
2. For each edge point, iterate over possible radii (\( r \)) and center coordinates (\( a, b \)).
3. Accumulate votes in a 3D accumulator array (\( a, b, r \)).
4. Identify peaks in the accumulator array to detect circles.

## 3. Practical Considerations
- **Preprocessing**: Noise reduction (e.g., Gaussian blur) is crucial for accurate results.
- **Resolution**: Choose appropriate step sizes for \( \rho \), \( \theta \), \( a, b, \) and \( r \) to balance accuracy and computation.
- **Thresholding**: Apply thresholds to suppress weak or insignificant peaks in the accumulator arrays.

## 4. Applications
- Line detection in road lanes for autonomous driving.
- Circle detection in object recognition (e.g., traffic signs, coins).
- Shape analysis in medical imaging and robotics.
